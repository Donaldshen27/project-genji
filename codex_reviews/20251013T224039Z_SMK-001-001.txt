APPROVE: Patch is a no-op—the file content stays `new workflow smoketest`, preserving the required single trailing newline and leaving other files untouched.

Ticket: SMK-001-001


Context provided:
- description: Validate smoketest.md file at repository root with workflow validation message. This is a P0 validation task to verify the patch-based workflow system. The file already exists with correct content ('new workflow smoketest' with POSIX-compliant newline). This patch provides integration tests to validate the file meets all contract requirements.
- context: Ticket SMK-001-001 from work_items.json. This is a workflow smoketest with no external dependencies. Contract specifies UTF-8 encoding, exact content match with single trailing newline, and that no other files should be modified. The patch is a no-op on smoketest.md (file already correct) and adds comprehensive integration tests for future workflow validation runs.
- notes: This patch validates an existing file and provides integration tests for the implementer-integrator workflow. The smoketest.md file already exists with correct content, so the main patch is a no-op. Edge cases covered in tests: (1) File existence verification; (2) Exact content match with single newline, no extra whitespace; (3) UTF-8 encoding; (4) Explicit trailing newline verification using byte-level check; (5) Git status isolation check using exact path matching to properly fail when unrelated files are modified, while allowing only the test script itself and the patch JSON file. The integration test script uses dynamic path resolution, process substitution to avoid subshell issues, and explicit newline validation to ensure portability across different environments.

Please assess this entire patch set and respond with one of the following:

1. If every change is correct, safe, and ready to merge, start your response with 'APPROVE:' followed by a brief confirmation (feel free to mention any key points you checked).

2. If you spot any issue—incorrect logic, missing context, regressions, tests needed, etc.—start your response with 'REJECT:' followed by:
   - What is wrong
   - Specific suggestions for how to fix it
   - What the corrected code should look like or what additional work is required

Evaluate the diff holistically; approving partial fixes is not allowed. Only approve if you're completely satisfied with the combined changes.
