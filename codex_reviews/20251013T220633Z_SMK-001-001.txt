Review this unified diff before it's applied:

Ticket: SMK-001-001


Context provided:
- description: Create smoketest.md file to validate the patch-based subagent workflow (planner → skeletoner → implementer → integrator). This minimal file creation task serves as a smoke test to confirm the integration pipeline can successfully apply patches, track changes via git, and verify postconditions without side effects.
- context: References SMK-001 spec at /home/donaldshen27/projects/donald_trading_model/docs/planning/spec.md. Work item SMK-001-001 from tickets/work_items.json defines a trivial file_creation task with hardcoded content 'new workflow smoketest\n'. Contract specifies: file_path at repository root, UTF-8 encoding, 0644 permissions, exactly one newline terminator. Postconditions require file existence, exact content match, git tracking, and no modifications to existing files (invariant). This aligns with AD-1 (single file approach) and AD-2 (root-level placement) from the spec.
- notes: This patch creates a new file from scratch (no prior existence). Unified diff includes standard headers: '--- /dev/null' for non-existent source and '+++ smoketest.md' for target file. The '@@ -0,0 +1 @@' hunk header indicates zero lines in original and one line added at position 1. Content is exactly 'new workflow smoketest' followed by POSIX-compliant newline. No logic, imports, or dependencies required. This stub represents the complete implementation for the smoketest ticket.

Proposed change (unified diff):
```diff
--- /dev/null
+++ smoketest.md
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+new workflow smoketest

```

Please assess this entire patch set and respond with one of the following:

1. If every change is correct, safe, and ready to merge, start your response with 'APPROVE:' followed by a brief confirmation (feel free to mention any key points you checked).

2. If you spot any issue—incorrect logic, missing context, regressions, tests needed, etc.—start your response with 'REJECT:' followed by:
   - What is wrong
   - Specific suggestions for how to fix it
   - What the corrected code should look like or what additional work is required

Evaluate the diff holistically; approving partial fixes is not allowed. Only approve if you're completely satisfied with the combined changes.
